# Machine-Learning
I undertook this project to develop an efficient deep learning model for detecting brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs). The primary objective was to classify images into "Tumor Detected" or "No Tumor Detected" categories, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
